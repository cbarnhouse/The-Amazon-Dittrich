# The-Amazon-Dittrich

This is a parody website written with HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap. One of my professors (Dittrich) says really interesting one-liners in class so I got the idea to record them and replace Alexa's voice from an Amazon Echo commercial with his one-liners, and market it as the "Amazon Dittrich." This site is a hypothetical product site for it, including a home page, product page, information page, and a small purchase page. This is front-end only with no working back-end as I did not have that knowledge at the time.

It even has its own commercial! You can check out the commerical for the Amazon Dittrich on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnywJF--zGg

Obviously I have no affiliations with Amazon or its products and the Amazon Dittrich isn't a real product. This is just a creative and funny project I did for class!
